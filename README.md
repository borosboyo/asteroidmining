ASTEROID MINING

Humanity has decided to exploit the resources contained in asteroids. In order to do this, the settlers
have to build a space station in the asteroid belt. The resources to build a space station would be too
expensive to transport there, so the settlers have to mine them from the asteroids.

Players of the game control the settlers. Settlers wander in the asteroid belt with single person
spaceships looking for resources.

Asteroids are covered in rocks. The depth of this rock mantle can vary from asteroid to asteroid. The
important resources (water ice, iron, carbon, etc.) can be found in the core of the asteroids. There are
also dangerous asteroids, whose core is highly radioactive. There can be hollow asteroids, whose core
is empty. The core of an asteroid is always homogeneous; it is always made of a single kind of a
material.

A settler can do one operation in a single move. The possible operations are: travel, drill, mine. When
a settler travels, they go to a neighboring asteroid (an asteroid may have multiple hundreds of
neighbors). When a settler drills, they deepen the hole in the mantle with one unit. When a settler
mines, they extract the resource from the core of the asteroid. This is only possible if the mantle has
been completely drilled through.

There are some dangers lurking in the asteroid belt. If a settler drills into the core of a radioactive
asteroid, and the asteroid is at perihelion, the asteroid explodes and the settler dies. Radioactive
material, therefore, can only be mined when the asteroid is at aphelion. Sometimes a sun storm
reaches the asteroid belt, and it is also dangerous to the settlers. A settler can only survive a sun storm
if they hide in the core of a hollow asteroid. This, of course, is only possible if the mantle has been
drilled through.

Autonomous robots controlled by artificial intelligence help the settlers. They can only travel between
asteroids and drill holes. Robots cannot mine, since they are unable to transport things. However,
robots survive radioactive explosions and they land on a neighboring asteroid. Sun storms do damage
robots unless they hide in a hollow asteroid.

The game can end in two ways. If all the settlers die, the players lose. If, however, they can mine at
least one unit of each resource and they collect those materials on a single asteroid, they can build
the space station and the players win the game.

Ambiguous requirements or any requirement not precisely described above can be freely customized
as you like. Usually, it is best to choose the easier solution.
